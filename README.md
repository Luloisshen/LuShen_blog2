    - Video has to be in a gif format. The best way to create a gif animation video is using "ffmpeg" in terminal, Another way is sending to Lu Shen. She will switch them. 
    - Publications and ADS need update once new paper comes out. If you see out-of-date, connect Lu Shen. In addition, if you think another figure in your paper is better to present your paper, please send to Lu Shen. She will help to switch it. 
    - Data is not ready yet. Right now, it will direct you to a github repo. It shows in the README that "If you are interesting in data, please an email to ORELSE@ucdavis.edu."
